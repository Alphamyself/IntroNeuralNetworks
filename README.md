# Practical Neural Networks from the Basics

### Course Objectives

- Learn what **machine learning** is, and how its used.
- Become comfortable with many commonly heard **terms** of machine learning at a high level (_more concept, less math_)
  - forward propogation
  - activation function
  - loss function
  - learning rate
  - gradient decent
  - backwards propagation
  - batches
  - epochs
- Start using some of the tools for Neural Network programming (sklearn, some helpful datascience packages like numpy, pandas, seaborn)
- Build a predictive (regression and classification) ML model using sklearn and interpret the output

### Quickstart Instructions

Thanks to our friends at **Jupyter Binder**, you can now run the code in an interactive enviroment without installing or downloading anything ðŸŽ‰. Please click the following link to run in the browser.

While this is convenient, there are a few limitations including slower computation speed. If you would like to run on your own machine, I have some instructions in docs/installation.md. If you have done this type of thing before, you know what to do with the **requirements.txt** file. ðŸ˜‰
