# Practical Neural Networks from the Basics

### Click for Demo: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/josiahcoad/IntroNeuralNetworks/master)

You can even run the demo *on your phone*! üì± Clicking the link opens a **Jupyter Binder** in your browser where you can run the code in an interactive enviroment *without installing or downloading anything* üéâ. Please give it a few minutes to boot up.‚è±Ô∏è


### Course Objectives

- Learn what **machine learning** is, and how its used.
- Become comfortable with many commonly heard **terms** of machine learning at a high level (_more concept, less math_)
  - forward propogation
  - activation function
  - loss function
  - learning rate
  - gradient decent
  - backwards propagation
  - batches
  - epochs
- Start using some of the tools for Neural Network programming (sklearn, some helpful datascience packages like numpy, pandas, seaborn)
- Build a predictive (regression and classification) ML model using sklearn and interpret the output

### Download Instructions

While the binder is so convienent, there are a few limitations including slower computation speed. If you would like to run on your own machine, I have some instructions in docs/installation.md. If you have done this type of thing before, you know what to do with the **requirements.txt** file. üòâ
