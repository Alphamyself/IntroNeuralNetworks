A vizualization of a convolusional networks applied to the mnist data set (past the scope of this class but interesting):

Further learning:
  - Bit-size free tutorials for many machine learning methods:

  - Interactive courses for learning data science (paid but worth it) and machine learning: 
  https://www.datacamp.com/
  - Another open source interactive course for neural networks that seems good (a little more math intensive)
