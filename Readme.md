![Oxford Course Banner](https://scontent-lht6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/23550047_1857784714249682_818662786257132584_o.jpg?oh=58428ed99e30824d180088dc46de3615&oe=5AA37404 "Banner")

### Course Objectives
- Learn what deep learning is, and how it relates to simple statistical models.
- Become comfortable with many commonly heard words of machine learning at a high level (more concept, less math)
  - forward propogation
  - activation functions
  - loss functions
  - learning rate
  - backwards propagation and gradient decent
  - epochs and batches
- Start using some of the tools for Neural Network programming (numpy, pandas, keras)
- Build a predictive (regression and classification) ML model using keras and interpret the output
- **Final: Classify digits with the MNIST data set**

Please note the programming instructions and slides for each lesson are explained in person and thus not fully documented online.  

Please also note that the course structure has been gleaned from other superb online courses (ie *Deep Learning in Python* from datacamp.com) and thus may look familiar if you've taken other online classes.  
#### Repository Structure
* ./Practicals
  * fill-in-the-blanks in the code to deepen your understanding of the code behind the concepts.
* ./Solutions
  * Stuck with one of the coding practicals? Check out the solutions for each practical where all the blanks are filled in.  
* ./Quizes
  * Test your knowledge with these interactive questionairs. See immediately how you compare to others who have answered the questions.  

#### Setup
Start here to setup for Chapter 1-2!  

* Download this git repository.   
  * click the green button "Clone or Download" in top right hand corner  ![Green Button Img](https://s31.postimg.org/r45t0i9a3/imageedit_9_4620369683.jpg)
  * click "Download Zip"  
  * Open file location on your computer and unzip folder
  * Move folder to place where you can find it easily

##### Download Install Anacondas
* Download Anaconda [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos). Choose the Python 3.6 version. (This might take 20 minutes)
* Choose the graphical installer if prompted. ![Anaconda page img](https://3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Choose-Anaconda-Download-for-Your-Platform.png)
* Double click the downloaded folder to launch the installer.
* Installing the Anaconda wizard is straight forward. Just click through all the options without changing anything. ![install Anaconda img](https://3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Anaconda-Python-Installation-Wizard.png)
* Open Anaconda Graphical User Interface ![Anaconda GUI img](https://3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Anaconda-Navigator-GUI-1024x635.png)

##### Open Jupyter Notebook and Navigate to the Neural Networks folder
* Click "open" on Jupyter Notebook
* It will open a file navigator in your browser ![file navigator img](https://github.com/josiahcoad/Intro-Neural-Networks/blob/master/TutorialPics/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-18%20at%2010.39.21%20PM.png?raw=true)
* Navigate to where you put the Neural Networks folder ![Neural Networks folder img](https://github.com/josiahcoad/Intro-Neural-Networks/blob/master/TutorialPics/Screen%20Shot%202017-12-18%20at%2010.40.01%20PM.png?raw=true)

#### Setup for Chapter 3-4
